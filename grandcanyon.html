				<h2>Usability Study & Website Redesign</h2>
				<p>Grand Canyon Tour and Travelâ€™s website was in clear need of a redesign. Through multiple rounds of usability testing, problems were identified and the site structure and layout were redesigned. This resulted in a site with improved navigation menus, consistent naming systems, and an overall cleaner appearance.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Original Website</h3>
				<p>The site's cluttered layout and disorganized structure made it frustrating to navigate and find information.</p>
				<div class="img-grid">

					<img src="images/gctt/gctt-original2.png" class="img-border" alt="Screenshot of the original tour page.">	
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Testing & Analysis</h3>
				<p>Testing began with conducting a heuristic analysis, followed by card sorting and questionnaire surveys sent out to potential users, and finally in-person observational testing. The biggest issues identified were confusing tour organization and difficulty finding general tour information and FAQs.</p>
				<p>The tour naming system was standardized, and sub-categories were added to the dropdown menu. The tour information page was moved to the main navigation instead of being stuck in the footer, and a clear link to the FAQ page was added to the tour information.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Mockups</h3>
				<p>Based on the research results, mockups of the redesigned site were created in Photoshop.</p>
