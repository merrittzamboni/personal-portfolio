				<h1>Voices from the SBS Summit</h1>
				<h2>Logo & Cover Design</h2>
				<p>Voices from the SBS Summit is a monthly podcast brought to you by The Threat Lab, DoD’s Counter-Insider Threat Program, and the National Insider Threat Task Force. This podcast features conversations with Threat Lab team members and presenters from The Threat Lab’s annual Counter-Insider Threat Social and Behavioral Science Summit.</p>

				<h3>Logo & Cover Design Process</h3>
				<p>As the podcast is a follow-up companion to the C-InT SBS Summit, the design of the logo and cover art needed to reflect the visual style of the conference. The branding for the podcast was based off of the SBS Summit 2021 website, seen below.</p>

				<p>A wide range of logos and covers were designed.</p>

				<h3>Final Selection</h3>
				<p>After several rounds of design reviews, it was narrowed down to four contenders.</p>

The other two covers each have a mountain made up of colorful oblong shapes; one has a red summit, and the other has a yellow summit."><br>
				<p>The final selection was made and mockups created to show proof of concept.</p>
